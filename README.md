# audioware

CP2077 modding tool to expose a new audio backend.

Currently in its infancy, further information will be provided at a later time.

## features

- [x] automatically registers voices audio files with their localized subtitles from file in YAML format.
- [x] allows playing sounds **without** [REDmod](https://wiki.redmodding.org/cyberpunk-2077-modding/for-mod-creators/modding-tools/redmod/audio-modding#audio-modding-manually).
- [x] seamlessly integrates with vanilla `AudioSystem`, but currently restricted to:
      - `Play`
      - `Stop`

### dependent features

Thanks to [Codeware](https://github.com/psiberx/cp2077-codeware), this plugin will _automatically_:

- [x] register all subtitles for [localization](https://github.com/psiberx/cp2077-codeware/wiki#localization) via `ModLocalizationProvider` and `ModLocalizationPackage`.
- [x] show/hide subtitle in the appropriate language whenever a custom voice audio is played.

- [@DevNullx64](https://github.com/DevNullx64): for helping in my first steps in assembly and understanding basic C++, and simply for being a formidable friend.
- [@WopsS](https://github.com/WopsS): for being the author of [RED4ext.SDK](https://github.com/WopsS/RED4ext.SDK) on which all Cyberpunk modding tools are based.
